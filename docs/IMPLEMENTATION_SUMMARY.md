# Watch Simulator - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Fully Functional Dashboard

The watch simulator is now **fully functional** with real-time simulation and data visualization.

### 🎯 Core Features Implemented

#### 1. **Timer Engine** (Milestone 2)
- ✅ RTC (Real-Time Clock) simulator
- ✅ Adjustable playback speed (x1 to x1000)
- ✅ NEW_SECOND and NEW_MINUTE events
- ✅ Accurate timestamp tracking
- ✅ Start/Pause/Resume controls

#### 2. **Step Generator** (Milestone 3)
- ✅ Realistic step generation based on archetypes
- ✅ 4 person archetypes: Office, Athlete, Sedentary, Active
- ✅ Hourly activity patterns
- ✅ NEW_STEP events with step counts
- ✅ Integration with device states

#### 3. **State Machine** (Milestone 4)
- ✅ Device states: SLEEP, IDLE, BACKGROUND, ACTIVE
- ✅ Automatic state transitions based on activity
- ✅ NEW_STATE events
- ✅ State multipliers affecting step generation

#### 4. **Data Visualization** (Milestone 1)
- ✅ **Steps per Hour Chart** (168 hours = 7 days)
  - Bar chart with actual step data
  - Smoothed line overlay (Hann window)
  - Adjustable smoothing: 5h, 7h, 9h
  - Always 168 data points (pads with zeros if needed)

- ✅ **Steps per Day Chart** (365 days = 1 year)
  - Bar chart with daily totals
  - Smoothed line overlay (Hann window)
  - Adjustable smoothing: 7d, 15d, 21d
  - Always 365 data points (pads with zeros if needed)

#### 5. **Event Logging**
- ✅ Real-time event display
- ✅ Event types: NEW_SECOND, NEW_MINUTE, NEW_STEP, NEW_STATE
- ✅ Event filtering by type
- ✅ Color-coded event badges
- ✅ Scrollable log (last 100 events)
- ✅ Clear events functionality

#### 6. **Control Panel**
- ✅ Speed slider (x1 to x1000) with real-time display
- ✅ Start date selector
- ✅ Duration selector (1-30 days)
- ✅ Archetype selector
- ✅ Start/Pause toggle button
- ✅ Progress bar showing simulation progress
- ✅ Save to JSON export
- ✅ Real-time RTC display

### 📊 How It Works

1. **Start Simulation**:
   - Click "Start" button
   - Timer engine begins at selected start date
   - Step generator starts producing steps based on archetype
   - State machine monitors activity and changes device states

2. **Real-Time Updates**:
   - Every second: NEW_SECOND event, steps generated
   - Every minute: NEW_MINUTE event, state machine update
   - Charts update in real-time as steps accumulate
   - Event log shows all events with timestamps

3. **Data Flow**:
   ```
   TimerEngine → StepGenerator → Redux State → Charts
                      ↓
                StateMachine → NEW_STATE events
   ```

4. **Chart Data**:
   - Steps are accumulated in 168-hour and 365-day arrays
   - Hann window smoothing applied for trend visualization
   - Charts always show full 168/365 data points
   - Automatically wraps/pads data as needed

### 🎮 Testing the Simulation

1. **Basic Test**:
   - Set speed to x10
   - Set duration to 7 days
   - Click Start
   - Watch charts fill with data
   - See events in log panel

2. **High-Speed Test**:
   - Set speed to x1000
   - Duration: 7 days
   - Simulation completes in ~10 minutes
   - Charts show full week of data

3. **Archetype Comparison**:
   - Run simulation with "Office" archetype
   - Note step patterns (low at night, moderate during day)
   - Reset and try "Athlete" archetype
   - See higher step counts and different patterns

### 🔧 Technical Implementation

**Redux State Structure**:
```typescript
{
  timer: {
    isRunning: boolean,
    speed: number,
    startDate: string,
    duration: number,
    archetype: string,
    progress: number,
    currentTime: RTCTime,
    events: LogEvent[],
    hourlySteps: number[168],  // Real-time step data
    dailySteps: number[365],    // Real-time step data
  }
}
```

**Key Files**:
- `src/lib/timer/TimerEngine.ts` - Core time simulation
- `src/lib/steps/StepGenerator.ts` - Step generation logic
- `src/lib/state/StateMachine.ts` - Device state management
- `src/lib/timer/useTimer.ts` - React hook integrating all engines
- `src/components/VisualizationPanel.tsx` - Charts with real data
- `src/components/ControlPanel.tsx` - Simulation controls
- `src/components/EventLogPanel.tsx` - Event logging UI

### 📈 Performance

- **Event Generation**: Up to 1000x real-time
- **Chart Updates**: Optimized with useMemo
- **Event Log**: Limited to 100 events to prevent memory issues
- **Smoothing**: Efficient Hann window algorithm
- **Redux**: Debounced localStorage saves (500ms)

### 🎯 What's Working

✅ Timer runs at variable speeds (x1 to x1000)
✅ Steps generate based on time of day and archetype
✅ Charts update in real-time with actual simulation data
✅ State machine transitions between SLEEP/IDLE/BACKGROUND/ACTIVE
✅ Events log all simulation activities
✅ Progress bar tracks simulation completion
✅ Data persists in localStorage
✅ Export to JSON works
✅ All controls are functional

### 🚀 Ready For

The simulator is now ready for:
- Testing sleep-wake cycle algorithms
- Validating step counting logic
- Analyzing activity patterns
- Debugging state transitions
- Exporting simulation data for analysis

### 📝 Usage

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit http://localhost:3000

1. Select archetype (Office, Athlete, etc.)
2. Set speed (recommend x10-x100 for testing)
3. Set duration (7 days recommended)
4. Click Start
5. Watch real-time simulation
6. View charts updating with step data
7. Monitor events in log panel
8. Export data when complete
